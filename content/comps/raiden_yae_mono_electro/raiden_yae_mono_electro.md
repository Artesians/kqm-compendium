# **Notes**

It's the most balanced Mono Electro team that involves Raiden and Yae that splits the buffs and damage relatively equally between the two of them. While comps with other Anemo units might have higher DPS ceilings, this team provides survivability without a major DPS loss compared to the other alternatives.
