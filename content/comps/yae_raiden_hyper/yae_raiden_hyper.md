# **Notes**

This calc uses Free-To-Play gear on all units. Swaps need to be done fast, especially once Bennett puts down his field. Make sure Bennett gets some energy when he performs EQ. Getting interrupted is detrimental to DPS. Similar to other Raiden teams, scales well with better Gear and Constellations. The comp also performs well in AoE scenarios. Unlike Raiden Sara Bennett Kazuha, damage is less front-loaded, making moments where Raiden kills things without restoring energy less common. In addition, Yae can burst down easier waves in multi-wave content and have Raiden burst down the tankier waves. 

# **Rotation Notes**

**First Rotation:**  
Yae EEE  
Raiden E (first rotation)  
Kazuha hEp  
Bennett EQ  
Yae Q EEE  
Kazuha Q  
Raiden Q 3N3C E (can be any normal attack combo)  

**Subsequent Rotations:**  
Yae EEE  
Kazuha hEp  
Bennett EQ  
Yae Q EEE  
Kazuha Q   
Raiden Q 3N3C (E) (can be any normal attack combo, only perform E again if you still need more rotations)

**Disclaimer:** Dashing used to dodge in the video along with hitlag and relatively slow swaps all were factors into rotation time differences. Sim time should be as fast as you can go.

**Note About Sim:** Energy is set to infinite to allow for multiple rotations to be done for timing purposes. ER% requirements were calcuated through an Energy Recharge Calculator. Other stats were inputed through a substat solver. These stats were used on the characters in the sim.
