# **Notes**

This calc uses Free-To-Play gear on all units and C0 Raiden. Players should make sure to weave in N0 or N1 when swapping characters to launch more rainswords with Xingqiu; because the rotation is time-constrained by Xingqiu's 21 second E cooldown, players are allowed a little bit of leeway. Additionally, this rotation assumes 2N4C N2C, but slightly more effective combos (that were discovered later) exist. 

For investment, players should focus on Raiden and Xiangling. In single-target, Xiangling will outdamage Raiden, but Raiden can end up outdamaging Xiangling in multi-target if Xiangling cannot vaporize her pyronado hits against all targets. 

# **Rotation Notes**

**First Rotation:**  
Raiden E  
Xingqiu EQ N1  
Bennett QE (feed into Xiangling)  
Xiangling QE N1  
Raiden Q 2N4C N2C  
Bennett N1 E  
Swap to Xiangling  
Raiden E (repeats)
