# **Notes**

Special thanks to ItzSomebody#0029 for his help.
Classic Hu Tao Team. Performs excellently in Single-Target, and one of the units have fairly low gearing requirements, while all of them have relatively F2P friendly gearings, meaning it'll scale well with higher investment. 
Hu Tao stacks a lot of buffs, from Instructor, and Sucrose with her passives and TToDS to deal tremendous amounts of DMG in a short window with her Elemental Skill. 
However, the team presents few downsides, notably the need of Canceled Charged Attack on Hu Tao, the lack of Shield and Heals, as well as being influenced by Xingqiu and Sucrose Constellations. 
It is also hard to execute, you need to VV both Hydro and Pyro, while providing all the buffs to Hu Tao, that will need to Vape all of her Charged Attacks to maximize the DPS. 


The sheet is rather "pessimistic" 
ER requirements are fairly high, Amber DMG is neglected (Lack of standards on 4* artifacts) 
Sucrose does not use Burst 
The DMG is averaged out for 2 rotations 



# **Rotation Notes**  

**First Rotation:**  
Xingqiu E  
Xingqiu Q  
Amber Q (remember to say on-field for a bit in order to let 4 Ins proc) 
Sucrose N1 
Sucrose Q  
Sucrose N2 
Hu Tao 8N1CJ  
  

**Disclaimer:** May require an extra attack on Sucrose in order to VV Hydro.
