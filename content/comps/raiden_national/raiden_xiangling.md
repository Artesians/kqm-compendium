pros:
    - strong in single target or small AoE
    - extremely easy to play
    - some room for rotation flexibility
    - forgiving in energy requirements given Raiden's battery capabilities
cons:
    - uses both Bennett and Xingqiu
    - less effective in multi-target because XQ can't apply hydro in AOE
    - lack of CC and overload can knock away enemies

# **Notes**

This calc uses Free-To-Play gear on all units and C0 Raiden. Players should make sure to weave in N0 or N1 when swapping characters to launch more rainswords with Xingqiu; because the rotation is time-constrained by Xingqiu's 21 second E cooldown, players are allowed a little bit of leeway. Additionally, this rotation assumes 2N4C N2C, but slightly more effective combos (that were discovered later) exist. 

For investment, players should focus on Raiden and Xiangling. In single-target, Xiangling will outdamage Raiden, but Raiden can end up outdamaging Xiangling in multi-target if Xiangling cannot vaporize her pyronado hits against all targets. 

# **Rotation Notes**

Raiden E
Xingqiu EQ N1
Bennett QE (feed into Xiangling)
Xiangling QE N1
Raiden Q 2N4C N2C
Bennett N1 E
Swap to Xiangling
Raiden E (repeats)
