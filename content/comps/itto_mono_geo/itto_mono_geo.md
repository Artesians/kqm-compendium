pros:
  - Quite easy to play and rotate
  - Good sustained damage over a long period of time (the 15s of Itto's burst)
  - Scales well with gear (Redhorn, Serpent Spine) and consellations (Gorou C6, Itto C2/4/6)
  - Still quite good in AoE with Itto's charged attacks
cons:
  - No supplemental damage from reactions
  - Matchup dependent: struggles in content with spread out mobs, and Abyss elemental shield

# **Notes**
 
This calc uses Free-To-Play gear on all units, with the exception of the Favonius Lance on Zhongli; this can be replaced with Black Tassel. Itto's ER requirements can be higher than this depending on particle RNG. Itto's combos can be more damage than this one, but even this combo is relatively hard. Visit https://keqingmains.com/itto/ to learn more about his combos. 4ToM on Zhongli can be dropped with a <5% dps decrease.
